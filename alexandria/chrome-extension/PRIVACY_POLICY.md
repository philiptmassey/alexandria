# Privacy Policy

Effective date: [2026-02-01]

The Alexandria Chrome Extension ("Extension") lets you save the current tab URL
into your Alexandria unread queue.

## Data the Extension handles

- Current tab URL, only when you click the extension icon.
- App base URL, stored in Chrome sync storage so the Extension knows where to
  send requests.
- Authentication cookies are handled by your browser. The Extension does not
  read, store, or access cookie contents.

## How data is used

- The URL you save is sent to your Alexandria app at
  https://alexandria-psi.vercel.app/api/docs to add it to your unread queue.

## Data sharing

- Data is sent only to your Alexandria backend.
- The Extension does not use third-party analytics or advertising services.

## Data retention

- The Extension itself does not retain saved URLs.
- URLs are stored in your Alexandria account and follow your app's retention
  policies.
